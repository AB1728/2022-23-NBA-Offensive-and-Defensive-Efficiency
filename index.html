  <p> Tavern-style pizza is not particularly difficult compared with <a href="https://firstwefeast.com/features/pizza-style-taxonomy/">other styles</a>, but it does take a good amount of time from start to finish — several days in fact — but it’s largely hands-off. And, on the actual day of baking, you don’t have to deal with stretching or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/magazine/how-to-toss-a-pizza.html">tossing dough</a>, making it perfect for parties or for topping with kids. </p>
